  MLUG stands for Montreal Linux Users Group
<br />
<br />
  We are a group of hobbyists and professionals who want to promote GNU/Linux in
every aspect, be it business, education, home desktop...
<br />
<br />
  How the group originally started is beyond me, all I know (btw, I'm
Nicholas Accad, MLUG webmaster, also known as TON for The Other Nick,
that is because there is also Nick Sklav, who was there before me, one
member calls me TOWN, for The Other Wacky Nick.. anyway, TON stuck)..
like I was saying, all I know is that when I arrived in Montreal as an
immigrant back in May 2000, I was looking for a local LUG, and I
stumbled across MLUG, back then the URL was http://mlug.2y.net (dead
now) and it was running on a DSL connection from Alan's office (more
about Alan later), the mailing list was hosted at Topica
<br />
<br />
  Alan's office in Verdun is also where I attented my first meeting, and
it's where the meetings were held every now and then until we decided
to make it a fixed date (the second friday of the month). Coffee and
cookies/muffins/donuts were the main theme that got us together, we'd
just hang out, nothing formal.
<br />
<br />
  After a while, Paul T.
succeded in obtaining permission for us to meet in Vanier College,
which was great, at least for me, because VC is more central (it's in
St. Laurent). The meetings also became more formal, every month a
member or guest would choose a topic and make a short presentation on
it, usually 30-45 minutes, yes I took a turn, I did a talk about VPNs
and FreeS/WAN.
<br />
<br />
  We went through a bunch of bad times,
twice so far our sponsored hosting went bust on us, or got cracked, or
the sky fell on their heads, as a matter of fact, right now (March
2003) we just lost another sponsor and we're running on small box where
I host my own website. But then again when you are running on $0, don't
expect 'la vie en rose' :)
<br />
<br />
  We are in no way affiliated
with any company or organization, we do everything ourselves, those of
us who have resources offer them for free, and we'd like to keep it
that way, we did or will do several community projects, InstallFests,
FireStarters (Intro course in Linux), and just go around blaming M$ for
everything from global warming to the fall of the roman empire (j/k).
<br />
<br />
  So, if you are in the area and have nothing to do on a friday evening,
drop by, you'll love it, oh.. and bring a LART, nothing is more fun
that bashing Jared when he opens his mouth :P
<br />
<br />
NOTE: Meetings are on hold for now. If you are interested in starting them again, post your ideas on the mailing list.
